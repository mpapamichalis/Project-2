# BLOODLINES    

Our App allows users to register and log in as a local bloodbank to add new donors and patients to their database. Tables are created to store patient and donor credentials. All names are kept confidential in accordance to HIPAA.

**FUTURE FEATURES:**
 
 * Users will be able to search for specific blood types and see donors that match according to the specified blood type.
 * Users will be able to see when donors are eligible to donate again and request donor to donate if blood type supply is low.
 * Users will be able to see when patients last received a blood transfusion and from which donor they received it from.
